You can't get headers in CF basic logs and appending values to query string in a CF function don't help

  Standard CloudFront access logs (what you have now) include:
  - cs-uri-query - query parameters ✅
  - cs(Cookie) - cookies
  - cs(Referer) - referer header
  - cs(User-Agent) - user agent header
  - But NO generic cs-headers field ❌

  CloudFront real-time logs include:
  - cs-headers - all headers with values ✅
  - cs-header-names - all header names ✅


## Need realtime logs

Excellent question. Moving from simple logging to implementing usage-based billing raises the stakes significantly. The data you collect must be accurate, reliable, and auditable.

For usage-based billing, **logging at the origin (API Gateway) is the most robust and recommended approach.**

It provides the truest record of what work your backend actually performed for a given API key.

---

### Winner: Logging at the Origin (API Gateway)

This method treats your backend API as the "source of truth" for billable events. Your CloudFront Function will still run to extract the API key and add it to the request, but the actual recording of the usage happens at the API Gateway level.

#### Why it's better for billing:

*   **Accuracy (Source of Truth):** This is the most important factor. An API call is only truly "used" if it is successfully received and processed by your origin. Logging at the edge (CloudFront) would record requests that might have been served from the cache or blocked by a WAF rule *before* hitting your origin, which are typically not billable events. API Gateway logs what it actually processed.
*   **Auditability:** API Gateway logs sent to CloudWatch contain a unique `requestId` for every single invocation. This provides an ironclad audit trail. If a customer disputes a charge, you can trace it back to the exact request log entry that shows it was processed.
*   **Reliability and Durability:** This is a fully managed, serverless pipeline. API Gateway logging to CloudWatch Logs is a highly reliable, battle-tested AWS pattern. You are not responsible for managing the infrastructure that collects the billing data.
*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** The cost structure is straightforward and generally economical. You pay for API Gateway requests, CloudWatch log ingestion, and log storage. This is often cheaper than building and maintaining a real-time Kinesis pipeline.

#### Implementation Architecture:

1.  **Client Request:** A client sends a request with an `x-api-key` header to your CloudFront distribution.
2.  **CloudFront Function:** Your `viewer-request` function executes, extracts the API key, and adds it as a `cf_api_key` query parameter.
3.  **API Gateway Execution:** CloudFront forwards the modified request to API Gateway.
4.  **API Gateway Access Logging:** API Gateway processes the request and, based on your stage settings, writes a detailed access log to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. **This log entry now contains the query string with the customer's API key.**
5.  **Billing Data Processing:** You then process these logs from CloudWatch. This is typically done in batches (e.g., every hour or every 24 hours). A Lambda function can be triggered on a schedule to read the logs, aggregate the usage data per API key, and store the results in a database like Amazon DynamoDB or a data warehouse.

### Strong Alternative: CloudFront Real-Time Logs

This is a powerful option and is superior to origin logging in one specific scenario: **if you want to bill customers for every request that hits the edge, including those served from the cache.**

#### When to choose this method:

*   Your billing model counts data transfer or every edge request as "usage".
*   You need sub-minute, real-time visibility into usage for dashboards or dynamic quoting.
*   You want to separate the concern of usage tracking completely from your origin logic.

#### Challenges for Billing:

*   **Not the Backend Source of Truth:** You will be billing for requests that your origin may never have seen (cache hits). This must align with your business model.
*   **More Complex Pipeline:** You must set up and manage a data streaming pipeline: CloudFront -> Kinesis Data Stream -> Kinesis Firehose or Lambda for processing -> Storage (S3, Redshift, etc.). This has more components and potential failure points than the origin logging method.

### Less Recommended: Custom Logging with Lambda@Edge

This approach involves writing custom code to send log data to CloudWatch. While flexible, it is not ideal for a critical function like billing because you are essentially building a logging system yourself.

#### Why it's not ideal for billing:

*   **Reinventing the Wheel:** API Gateway and CloudFront Real-Time Logs are managed services designed specifically for this purpose.
*   **Added Risk:** Any bug in your Lambda@Edge logging code could lead to lost billing data, directly impacting revenue.
*   **Potential for Higher Cost:** Lambda@Edge is priced per-request and by duration, which can become more expensive than the dedicated logging mechanisms at high volume.

### Summary Comparison for Usage-Based Billing

| Feature | **Logging at Origin (API Gateway)** | **CloudFront Real-Time Logs** | **Lambda@Edge Custom Logging** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Accuracy** | **Excellent (Source of Truth)** | High (Logs edge activity, not origin) | Moderate (Depends on custom code) |
| **Reliability** | **Excellent** | Excellent | Good (Adds application-level risk) |
| **Auditability** | **Excellent (Unique Request IDs)** | Good | Moderate (Must be custom-built) |
| **Complexity** | **Low** | Medium | High |
| **Timeliness** | Near Real-Time (minutes) | Real-Time (seconds) | Near Real-Time (minutes) |
| **Best For** | Billing based on **backend processing** and actual work done. | Billing based on **all edge requests**, including cache hits and data transfer. | Complex edge logic where logging is a secondary, custom feature. |

**Final Recommendation:**

Stick with **logging at the origin via API Gateway**. It provides the most accurate and auditable data for a usage-based billing model where you charge customers for the resources they actually consume on your backend. This approach is simpler to implement, highly reliable, and easier to defend during a billing dispute.
